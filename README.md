# Ai-TradingPlatform-Coder built off of the original mckaywrigley/ai-code-translator but I plan on taking a different direction beyond ChatGPT, so I've created a new project all together.   
An experimental Project for Trading Platform Coding.


This is a backburner project, I'm unsure where it will lead, but I want to make code interoperable between trading platforms and more accessible to the public.
